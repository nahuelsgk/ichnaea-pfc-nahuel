The aim of this project is to develop divide-and-conquer algorithms for the routing of signals in nanoelectric standard cells. We work on an already existing cell synthesis framework so that more complex cells become tractable. We evaluate different strategies and try to find the ones with the best solution for a given cell and design rules, either on terms of quality or computational time.
